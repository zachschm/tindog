# tindog
This is my first project completed using bootstrap and css breakpoints. This was my third ever website created; it was very fun to make. This website is
a mock tinder website made with similar colors and fonts. In this project I learned many bootstrap features including menu bar, buttons, divisions,
containers, carousels, etc. This is just a single page site with menu bar funcitonality bringing the user to different id sections within the page.
Everything is funcitonal besides the download buttons and the social media connections within the contact section. I learned so much about css itself in 
this project including alignment, margin, padding, border, position, z-index, selectors, selector hierarchy, breakpoints, fonts, etc. This project is
purely for educational purposes and is simply a project made to learn html, css, and bootstrap. No copyright or infringement was intended. This web page
